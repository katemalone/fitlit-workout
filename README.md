# FitLit - It's Lit to be Fit

### Project Overview

FitLit is a fitness tracker comprised of information for 50 users, including their personal fitness goals as well as other related health statistics, such as daily number of steps, water intake, and sleep quality and quantity.


### Set Up

If you would like to run FitLit for yourself, simply clone down this repo and run `npm instal` in your terminal to ensure all vital dependncies are running properly.


### Testing

This project utilizes Test Driven Development - TDD - to ensure functionality (with the exception of testing for DOM functionality).

To check out the tests, run `npm install` (if you have not already) to ensure functionality of all testing dependencies. To run tests, run `npm run test`. To isolate tests, add `.only` in the assertions.
